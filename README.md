# Spotify Autoplayist

A project to store my song history and eventually do data viz + automatic playlist generation!!

# Environment

Create the conda environment I used for this project with 

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

# Running it yourself

To run `index_songs.py` yourself, you will need to set your `SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID`, `SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI` environment variables. 
You'll also need to change `username` in the script to be your spotify username (for now...)
