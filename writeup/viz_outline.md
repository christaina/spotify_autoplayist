# Visualizing Spotify Listening Patterns

I wanted to write up a quick summary of my methodology and takeaways for the [data visualization](https://christaina.github.io/spotify_autoplayist/graph_viz/) of my Spotify listening history. There's a lot of stuff I'd like to do/fix in the future so I want to outline that here as well.

## Motivation

I listen to music on Spotify every day. I have this habit where I'll queue up a bunch of songs based on my mood when I know I'm going to be listening to music for awhile instead of using a playlist. Several things affect what I put on--like what I'm doing (biking, working, going on a walk), and what I'm into at the moment.

I thought it would be interesting to see what songs often appear together in the same "listening session", and eventually use that to automatically generate playlists for myself based on patterns. For now, I've just created a graph visualization of my listening patterns using D3.
